### CPSC 120

* Lab 2 part 1

    This is my favorite lab because it was my very first time coding on this software. I had kind of tinkered with coding every now and then but not like actually making something. It was an easy lab to start off on, but looking back on it, I have come a long way since my first coding experience. 
    
* Lab 7 Part 2

    This lab is another favorite of mine because we were able to work with balckjack. We had to code card names and point values and if there's an ace and whether or not we would bust. It was really cool to see multiple parts of the code all work together to count points in a hand that the user inputs.

* Lab 12 part 2

    This lab was fun to code because of the outcome. The use of a random number generator was really unique and the image that the code made was cool to see happen. The two files we had to edit worked together along with the other two files that were already coded shows how there can be many parts of one code that all work together to create on thing. It kept the code clean and not above 200 lines of code during the whole process.
